        description: "Dada is a parenting app for fathers. It was developed by a team of 10 students, over a 5-week period, after which it was presented to the client as an MVP. We followed an Agile methodology. I took the opportunity to act as Project Manager, managing the team's workload, running stand-ups and retrospectives, updating tickets on Trello and communicating daily with the client. We worked to wireframes on Figma. The final MVP has a responsive layout, with breakpoints for mobile, tablet and desktop.",

        description: "The brief was to create a simple, keyboard-based, 2-player tug-of-war game within a single HTML page. It was coded using HTML, CSS and Javascript, without using images or canvas. I styled text and block elements in CSS to achieve the animated Moai head and made the game more skillful by requiring a sequence of key-presses by each player. There are 10 different Moai heads, generated by a string of punctuation. The game keeps track of wins and turned out to be more fun than it ought to be!",
